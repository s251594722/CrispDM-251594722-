      <h3>Real-World Example: Telecom Customer Churn</h3>
      <p>
        This case study demonstrates the application of the CRISP-DM methodology
        to predict customer churn in the telecommunications industry.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
      <p>
        The telecommunications industry experiences high customer churn due to
        competitive pricing, service dissatisfaction, and changing customer needs.
        Customer churn leads to revenue loss and increased costs associated with
        acquiring new customers.
      </p>
      <p>
        The objective of this project is to identify customers who are likely to
        leave the telecom service by analyzing historical customer data and
        predicting churn probabilities. Early identification allows the company
        to implement effective retention strategies.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Step 1: Business Understanding</h3>
      <p>
        Define the business objective of reducing customer churn and minimizing
        revenue loss by predicting customers at high risk of leaving the service.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Step 2: Data Understanding</h3>
      <p>
        Analyze customer demographics, service usage patterns, contract details,
        and billing history to identify factors influencing customer churn.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Step 3: Data Preparation</h3>
      <p>
        Clean the dataset by handling missing values, removing duplicates,
        encoding categorical variables, and preparing the data for modeling.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Step 4: Modeling</h3>
      <p>
        Apply machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression and
        Decision Trees to build predictive models that estimate churn probability.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Step 5: Evaluation</h3>
      <p>
        Evaluate the model using accuracy, precision, recall, and a confusion
        matrix. The model achieved an accuracy of approximately 85%.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Step 6: Deployment</h3>
      <p>
        Deploy the model into a business dashboard to support marketing and
        customer service teams in implementing targeted retention strategies.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Final Output of the Case Study</h3>
      <p>
        The final output of this CRISP-DM case study is a churn prediction model
        that classifies customers based on their likelihood of leaving the telecom
        service. The model enables proactive customer retention and supports
        data-driven decision-making.
      </p><br>
      <p>
        By applying this model, the company can:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Identify high-risk customers early</li>
        <li>Reduce customer churn through targeted retention actions</li>
        <li>Improve customer satisfaction and loyalty</li>
        <li>Increase overall business profitability</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Advantages & Limitations</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Advantages:</strong> Structured methodology, widely applicable,
        improves collaboration between business and technical teams, and increases
        project success rates.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Limitations:</strong> Can be time-consuming, requires strong domain
        knowledge, and may lack flexibility for rapidly changing data environments.
      </p>
